# DKs-Monolith-Toolhead
Designed by https://github.com/abigexplosion

This Toolhead requires A LOT of post processing it's not for the faint of heart.

Planned modifications include:

- Improved CAD
- Project timeline (DK is a menace)
- Helicoil support
- Regular BMG support
- PEEK tube-lined filament path
- 15/18mm CPAP tubing compatibility

I didn't make this CAD except the SLM Sherpa Micro idler and SLM 17-4PH Heatblock, The CAD is cursed as fuck and is not representitve of my work, I'll post my version seperately in the future.
